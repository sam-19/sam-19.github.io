## External libraries and resources

Development of this app would not have been possible without numerous open source javascript libraries and the tremendous contributions of their developers. The most important external libraries used in this project are:
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) 
- [Cornerstone.js](https://cornerstonejs.org/) and its submodules
  - CornerstoneMath
  - CornerstoneTools
  - DicomParser
  - WADOImageLoader
- [Hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/) (as a dependency of Cornerstone.js)
- [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/)

[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) SVG-icons are extensively used in the app and also in some parts of these docs. Because the app leverages my license of FontAwesome Pro, _you cannot build the app unless you have access to FontAwesome Pro!_ We are working on a solution to this problem.
