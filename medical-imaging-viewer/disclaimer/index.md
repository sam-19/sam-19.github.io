## 2. Patient identification

Medical imaging records can contain various forms of information that can be used to identify the patient. This information includes not only the metadata embedded into the record files (such as DICOM data fields), but also the data itself; for example dental records can be used in forensic science to identify a person. The software cannot and does not even attempt to remove or hide this information. All records must therefore be cleared of any potentially identifying information (i.e. anonymized) _prior_ to being displayed in the software.

__Always make sure that all material has been properly anonymized before using it in the software!__
