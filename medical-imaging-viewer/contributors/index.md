## External libraries and resources

Development of this software would not have been possible without numerous open source javascript libraries and the tremendous contributions of their developers. The most important external libraries used in this project are:
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) 
- [Cornerstone.js](https://cornerstonejs.org/) and its submodules
  - CornerstoneMath
  - CornerstoneTools
  - DicomParser
  - WADOImageLoader
- [Hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/) (as a dependency of Cornerstone.js)
- [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/)

[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) SVG-icons are used extensively in the software and also in some parts of these docs. Since we don't have a graphical designer in the project I have been forced to use my personal license of FontAwesome Pro, which means _you cannot build the app unless you have access to FontAwesome Pro!_ This is regrettable and we are working on a solution to this problem.
